You can see previous version of this privacy policy, as well as the last time it was modified, [on GitHub.](https://github.com/Glitch-Entertainment/glitch-site/blob/master/privacy.md)

By using this website, you agree to this privacy policy.

**I. Data We Collect and Why**
We do not directly collect any data on site visitors. We do use, however, [Flag Analytics](https://flagby.doamatto.xyz) to see which pages of our site are the most popular and to see how popular our site is overall. This allows us to better judge how we should manage our hosting and, if need be, upgrade to better servers.

**II. Data Sharing**
As per Flag Analytics' requirements, all data collected via Flag is never shared with anyone.

**III. CCPA, GDPR, and Other Privacy Clauses**
We do not collect, nor sell any personal information. We also cannot track users directly back to an individual, per design of Flag Analytics. 

**IV. Do Not Track Requests and Opting-Out of Analytics**
If your browser send a Do-Not-Track (DNT) request, no data will be collected by the analytical tool.

**V. Data Security**
We do not collect enough information to alert you, the site visitor, of any data breaches. The data we collect, however, is not personally-identifiable information (PII) and, for that reason, is not at any risk if lost, stolen, or destroyed.

**V. Contact**
If you have an issue with this privacy policy, you can reach out to us via email at **[glitch-placeholder \[at\] doamatto.xyz](mailto:glitch-placeholder@doamatto.xyz)**
